Background information about methods for identifying tapes and media changers  
On older systems, most tape drives were connected to the system through SCSI. In those cases, the system needed only to scan the SCSI bus to identify all the peripherals that were attached to it. However, if drives were removed or added after the system was booted, the system was not aware of the changes. A reboot was required before the configurations took effect. This method of direct connect SCSI tape device did not allow for hot swapping or dynamically changing tape configurations after the system was running.

After a tape drive is discovered by the system, the drive is allocated a name using the format stn, where n is a number assigned to the drive based on when it was discovered. Tape libraries (also known as media changers mc) follow a similar naming convention. The following are some limitations with earlier naming conventions:

NetApp delivers certified Fibre Channel (FC) Fabric TapeSAN backup solutions with multiple switch and tape storage vendors for data management in enterprise SAN environments.
Open Storage Networking NetApp has a strategy for delivering the best storage networking product solutions in the industry. We have a deep commitment to the integral technologies as well as a deep expertise in these technologies. We strongly believe that our vision of what storage networking means to customers-as well as the inherent capabilities of our company-is what makes us an industry leader. This is an exciting movement forward for both NetApp and our customers, since we are already embedded into the key solutions customers choose today as well as into the future.
What is storage networking? What is Open Storage Networking (OSN)? Storage networking allows companies to deliver data anywhere, any way, in any quantity, anytime, and any type of data...with data that is always available. Open means that companies can construct best-of-breed solutions that can easily incorporate legacy equipment as well as new and emerging technologies. Standards are the essence of open systems, meaning that companies can utilize and leverage their existing staff and skills base, current installed base of equipment, software, and management tools, as well as benefit from an extremely large and diverse base of mature suppliers to ensure that these companies can focus on their business problems and initiatives rather than guessing about which emerging technology to deploy.
Open storage networking means that in an age when the opportunities and issues are extraordinarily diverse, complicated, and compelling, companies can precisely calibrate their operations and business development efforts to yield the best return, use information to disarm and control their competition, and create higher than ever levels of company valuation.
Why is storage networking such an important development? Storage networking provides a sound architectural evolution away from the model of storage being directly attached to servers. The ability to redeploy, manage, centrally protect, and leverage data between servers and end users comes from the premise that a network is the link to data. In addition, by offloading the front-end networks from many of the activities that will be migrated to the storage network, you free up bandwidth thereby improving responsiveness for all network users. Separating the data from the servers allows customers to use solutions optimized for managing and deploying data.
What are the three most significant differentiating product features of OSN?
Advanced networking technology: Networking technology allows companies to put storage in the hands of users whenever and wherever they are and with the advantage of readily available, industry-standard management tools, skills, a tremendous bandwidth-improvement roadmap, and the most compelling TCO of any alternative for connecting storage, servers, and users.
Advanced data management-focused operating system: Data ONTAP™ software is an operating system that has been specifically designed to provide data-management tools and technologies in a network-oriented environment, thereby giving customers the ability to fully leverage the enormous investment they are making in data and information as well as giving customers a tool for managing the sheer magnitude of data and information they need to cope with (which is growing at an extraordinary rate).
Appliance architecture: The appliance architecture ensures the lowest possible TCO.
Which components make up an OSN? An OSN is made up of many components that are very familiar to NetApp customers. These components include:
Simplicity: It's a NetApp-infused solution, after all!
Heterogeneous data sharing
Homogeneous data consolidation
Greater scalability than direct-attached storage
High-speed tape backup and tape resource sharing
Well-established protocols and standards for file-level data protection and security
Investment protection because the solution leverages the installed base of equipment and personnel
Flexibility because it is a network that can grow, scale up, and change to meet new needs and challenges
Redundancy because it is a network and you can build failover and multiple paths to the storage network elements
Asynchronous mirroring for affordable replication solutions, which are essential to tomorrow's Internet-based business systems.
Everything that is special and powerful about NetApp technology such as the Snapshot™ capability
What is the goal of OSN? Data anywhere, anytime via integrated servers, switches, and storage devices.

On older systems, most tape drives were connected to the system through SCSI. In those cases, the system needed only to scan the SCSI bus to identify all the peripherals that were attached to it. However, if drives were removed or added after the system was booted, the system was not aware of the changes. A reboot was required before the configurations took effect. This method of direct connect SCSI tape device did not allow for hot swapping or dynamically changing tape configurations after the system was running.
This Fibre Channel fabric TapeSAN backup solution enables hot swapping and dynamically changing tape configurations after the system is running. A Fibre Channel tape drive or library can now be connected and disconnected from the Fibre Channel switch, and the switches rescans the ports to determine whether devices were added or removed. The system detects these configuration changes in real time. It disables access to drives that disappeared, and it exports new drives for the user.
Device naming convention
After a tape drive is discovered by the system, the drive is allocated a name using the format stn, where n is a number assigned to the drive based on when it was discovered. Tape libraries (also known as media changers mc) follow a similar naming convention. The following are some limitations with earlier naming conventions:
Data ONTAP assigns device addresses on a first-come first-served basis.
Assigned stn addresses do not move when the device is moved.
Addresses might not be reassigned in the same order after reboot
Unlike direct attached SCSI devices, the order of device discovery on a SAN is not fixed. New tape drives can be easily added or removed from the system. Names assigned to one device can be assigned to a different device after a reboot. This dynamic naming scheme is problematic with tape drives and libraries on a SAN. To solve this naming scheme problem, the tape aliasing method was developed.
Tape aliasing
Tape aliasing provides a correspondence between the logical names of a backup device, for example (st0, mc1), and a name permanently assigned to a port or to a tape device. The following are three naming schemes used to assign permanent names to logical names of tape devices:
Logical names
A logical name is the software assigned name given to the tape device by the system. The format for tape drive logical name is stn, where n is an integer greater than or equal to 0. The value of n is assigned to the drive based on when it was discovered. Tape libraries (also known as media changers mc) follow a similar naming convention.
Example: Logical name - dump 0f /dev/nrst0a /vol/vol0
Electrical or Physical path names (PPN)
A PPN is the numerical address sequence that Data ONTAP assigns to a tape drive and library based on which SCSI-2/3 adapter or switch they are connected to on the system. A PPN is also known as an electrical name.
Note: Different systems can have different PPNs for the same tape device.
Example: Electrical name - dump 0f /dev/nr.MY_SWITCH:5.6.a /vol/vol0
World wide names (WWN)
A WWN is assigned to tape devices at the time of manufacture. WWN applies only to Fibre Channel devices and not to SCSI devices.
Note: Accessing a tape device through the WWN enables multiple systems to track the same device. Also, using WWNs eliminates confusion in naming conventions sometimes caused by using PPNs.
Example: World wide name - dump 0f /dev/nr.WWN[2:000:00e08b:01523e].a /vol/vol0
Mapping tape aliases
The logical name assigned by the system can be mapped to the device PPN or WWN. In this event, assigned stn or mcn names have direct association with PPNs and WWNs.
Example: Logical name st0 can be mapped to PPN MY_SWITCH:5.6.a /vol/vol0
OR
Example: Logical name st0 can be mapped to WWN WWN 2:000:00e08b:01523e].a /vol/vol0
